# Project-EWP-GARCH-Model
Modeling and Forecasting Equally Weighted Portfolio Volatility: A GARCH(1,1) Approach

In this project, we analyze the daily log-returns of the equally weighted portfolio using the csv file provided portfolio and model its conditional volatility using a GARCH(1,1) framework, extended to include a jump component. Our goal is to capture volatility clustering and persistence typical of financial time series.
